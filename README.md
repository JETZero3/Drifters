# Drifters with Pencils

##### About
Drifters with Pencils is a webcomic site based around a comic that was started during my university days. I always enjoyed making comics and submitting them to the school newspaper (the Gauntlet). After I graduated, I wanted to keep going with the comics, so I created the site. 

The site currently runs with the Grav CMS. Currently, the site is set up so that when I add a comic to the archive folder, the rest of the site updates accordingly. This was both satisfying and helps lighten the load for publishing content.

##### Future Features
- Personal theme
	- Currently, the site runs on a modified version of the default Antimatter theme. I plan to create my own theme to control the spacing and fonts, while still maintaining the current functionality that is in place. 
	
- Automatic Facebook/Reddit posts .
	- Everytime a new comic gets uploaded, the Facebook page should post a new update for the comic and afterthought. As well, my Reddit account should publish posts on r/comics and r/webcomic.
