Real simple comic [tonight](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/sugar). 

Short post tonight. I can't stay up like I used to. At least on purpose anyway. 

I feel like a lot of people really don't enjoy black coffee. I get strange looks from my friends when I mention it. I also feel like I get most of my ideas from reversing words in sentences. 

New comic tomorrow. And by tomorrow, I mean February 27th, 2016. Just to be clear.
