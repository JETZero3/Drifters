I sure enjoyed clothes back in the day. 

I mean, when it comes to stick figures and clothes, it seems like a rather silly concept. I guess that's why I made [two](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/suspension) [comics](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/half-naked) out of it. I don't think I remember doing anymore. Could be wrong. We'll see. 

I'm going to be taking a break for the next day or two. I have some other things I'd like to focus my attention on. For tonight though, I'll be watching the Flames-Kings game...man, I pray that Ortio plays well in net tonight.
