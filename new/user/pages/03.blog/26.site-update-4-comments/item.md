**DOUBLE UPDATE: Comments back up again. Thank you for your patience.  **

Hey there. It's Jan again. I've activated a comments plugin. Right now, I only have it activated for the Afterthoughts. However, I could very much see it on the comic pages. 

A problem I could see is that the home page comments would be a different system from each individual comic page. This is because I simply take the most recent page from the comic folder, and stick that image on the home page. 

A remedy of this could simply be having comments on the archive pages only, leaving the home page without comments, which I'm not too broken up about. 

Another question: Are you okay with Facebook being the medium for comments? Let me know. 

Thoughts? Comments? Now you can express them.
