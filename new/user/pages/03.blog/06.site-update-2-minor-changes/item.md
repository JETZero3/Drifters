Just a minor update to the site overall. 

The sidebar's search bar and random article features have had their titles removed, so that less space is used overall. As well, you may have noticed the change from blue to green. I rather like green. 

Comic comes in tomorrow. It's safe to say that it's one of my favorites. Stay tuned.
