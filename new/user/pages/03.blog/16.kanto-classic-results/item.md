Click [here](http://drifterswithpencils.com/blog/kanto-classic-teambuilding) to go to Kanto Classic Part 1: Teambuilding. 

Hello, and welcome to the second of two posts featuring the Kanto Classic Online Competition. 
Here’s a quick rundown of the team in icon form: 

![Clefable](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/036.png) ![Machamp](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/068.png) ![Dragonite](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/149.png) ![Starmie](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/121.png) ![Nidoking](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/034.png) ![Snorlax](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/143.png) 

Game 1: Tai - ![Venusaur](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/003.png) ![Charizard](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/006.png) ![Blastoise](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/009.png) ![Kangaskhan](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/115.png) ![Dragonite](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/149.png) ![Gengar](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/094.png) 

The first match was against a player with a few underleveled Pokemon. It was a good first game to get used to the team. Win 2-0. 

Game 2: Noe – ![Dragonite](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/149.png) ![Alakazam](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/065.png) ![Gengar](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/094.png) ![Snorlax](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/143.png) ![Blastoise](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/009.png) ![Charizard](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/006.png) 

Noe carried some interesting sets. The start began with a Charizard that used Inferno and Fly, which was beyond unexpected. Starmie picked up knock outs on Charizard and Dragonite, and Snorlax picked up a knock out on Alakazam, before being destroyed by Noe’s Snorlax’s Giga Impact. This allowed my Dragonite to DDance up and sweep through the rest of Noe’s team. Win 4-0.

Game 3: M – ![Jynx](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/124.png) ![Blastoise](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/009.png) ![Victreebel](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/071.png) ![Ninetales](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/038.png) ![Rhydon](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/112.png) ![Pidgeot](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/018.png) 

M’s team somewhat scared me, realizing that my team was actually weak to a Victreebel in the sun. Fortunately for me, the Ninetales didn’t have Drought, and Victreebel tried to hit Clefable with a Poison Powder. Crisis averted. Win 6-0.

Game 4: shikurasu – ![Cloyster](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/091.png) ![Snorlax](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/143.png) ![Aerodactyl](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/142.png) ![Venusaur](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/003.png) ![Rapidash](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/078.png) ![Wigglytuff](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/040.png) 

The Rapidash was scary as all hell. It proceeded to destroy half of my team with a combination of Hypnosis, Fire Blast, and Horn Drill. After Rapidash was dealt with, Cloyster Shell Smashed on my Snorlax. Snorlax managed to 2HKO with Body Slam, and when Cloyster couldn’t OHKO Snorlax with Icicle Spear (thanks to Thick Fat), the opponent disconnected. 

Game 5: Jack Knight – ![Arcanine](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/059.png) ![Alakazam](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/065.png) ![Machamp](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/068.png) ![Dragonite](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/149.png) ![Gyarados](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/130.png) ![Gengar](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/094.png) 

Game 5 was also a disconnect. It was actually a relatively close game. My Dragonite managed to set up and start sweeping. When my opponent tried to bring in Machamp, it fainted from Stealth Rock damage, and the disconnect happened. 

Game 6: noa – ![Aerodactyl](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/142.png) ![Jolteon](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/135.png) ![Clefable](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/036.png) ![Nidoqueen](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/031.png) ![Arcanine](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/059.png) ![Cloyster](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/091.png)

For the first five games, I pretty much led with Clefable with the goal to set up Rocks as soon as possible. This time I predicted the Nidoqueen lead and led with Nidoking. He actually led Aerodactyl and set up his own Rocks and a Tailwind before being knocked out. Nidoqueen came out afterwards. Not willing to lose my Nidoking, I made the switch to Snorlax, taking an Earth Power quite well. He switched out to Arcanine, Intimidating my Snorlax and dropping my Attack. Snorlax just went for the Earthquake, being super effective on the Nidoqueen that was in. With the Intimidate, Snorlax shouldn’t have been able to knock out Arcanine. Lo and behold, a critical hit occurred, and Arcanine fell.  
Cloyster came in, and proceeded to Shell Smash on my weakened Snorlax. At that point, I had no choice but to try and hit Fissure. Lo and behold, the 30% chance to hit was in my favor, and Cloyster was immediately OHKO’d. Eventually Snorlax went down to Clefable. Not wanting to throw away the victory, I proceeded to sacrifice most of my Pokemon to preserve my win conditions. Win 2-0.

Game 7: Oswaldo – ![Starmie](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/121.png) ![Venusaur](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/003.png) ![Arcanine](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/059.png) ![Dragonite](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/149.png) ![Golem](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/076.png) ![Snorlax](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/143.png)

Game 7 was about two turns. He led with his Dragonite, facing off against my Clefable. His Dragonite used Iron Head twice, leaving my Clefable with a sliver of HP. My Clefable used Moonblast twice, 2HKOing Dragonite. Disconnect. 

Game 8: ELOY Z – ![Electrode](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/101.png) ![Zapdos](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/145.png) ![Clefable](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/036.png) ![Aerodactyl](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/142.png) ![Tauros](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/128.png) ![Starmie](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/121.png)

ELOY Z led off with the most obnoxious Electrode I’ve ever faced against my Clefable. Electrode and Clefable proceeded to Thunder Wave and Swagger and Moonblast each other for five minutes before Electrode fainted. Clefable quickly followed and Tauros eliminated it. Eventually, Starmie managed to clean up, surprisingly able to outspeed his Aerodactyl and knocking it out with Scald. Win 2-0. 

Game 9: rushanabutsu – ![Raichu](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/026.png) ![Cloyster](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/091.png) ![Snorlax](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/143.png) ![Slowbro](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/080.png) ![Nidoqueen](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/031.png) ![Dragonite](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/149.png)

Before the game started, I took note of this player’s rank being in the 1650s. I could tell this was not going to be an easy game, especially with his Slowbro-Snorlax-Nidoqueen defensive core. 
I sent out Clefable to get up Rocks, and promptly got destroyed by his Nidoqueen. My Snorlax came in, and knocked out Nidoqueen. His Slowbro came in, and Snorlax, not being able to deal with it, went for the Fissure, which connected.  
Then Cloyster came in and set up. And Shell Smashed up. And Snorlax missed Fissure. And Cloyster swept through my team. Loss 0-4. 

Game 10: Rhado – ![Hypno](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/097.png) ![Zapdos](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/145.png) ![Arcanine](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/059.png) ![Gengar](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/094.png) ![Tauros](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/128.png) ![Starmie](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/121.png)

Rhado led off with his Hypno, which certainly took me by surprise, in that it was a physical set. It proceeded to get off three Power-Up Punches on my Clefable, so I switched in my Dragonite on the third Power-Up Punch. Hypno then crit my Dragonite with a Zen Headbutt. May or may not have mattered. Then I stupidly sac’d my Machamp, before finally knocking the Hypno out with Nidoking. Nidoking managed to knock out Tauros as well, before getting revenge killed by his Arcanine. Eventually, his Gengar fell to my Snorlax, and Rhado forfeited, knowing that Snorlax and Starmie could clean up. Win 3-2

Game 11: Brian – ![Dragonite](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/149.png) ![Flareon](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/136.png) ![Clefable](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/036.png) ![Lapras](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/131.png) ![Zapdos](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/145.png) ![Gengar](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/094.png)

This game featured a lot of confusion hax. It started off very similar to game 7, except Dragonite wasn’t knocked out by Clefable. It was knocked out by Machamp with Bullet Punch. Zapdos proceeded to come in. Machamp, despite the type disadvantage, managed to take advantage of some confusion rolls off of Dynamic Punch. Gengar knocked Machamp out, before Starmie came in and revenge killed. This left Brian with a Flareon, Lapras, and Clefable. Clefable in a last ditch effort, tried to use Minimize to avoid all of the attacks. However, it was to no avail, as Nidoking managed to pick up the 2HKO with Sludge Wave. Win 4-0.

Game 12: kazuki – ![Weezing](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/110.png) ![Lapras](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/131.png) ![Jolteon](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/135.png) ![Chansey](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/113.png) ![Clefable](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/036.png) ![Dragonite](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/149.png)

I saw how obnoxiously defensive this team was, and I didn’t like my chances. There’s not much to say about this one, especially when Lapras takes out two of your Pokemon with Sheer Cold. Just not my game. Loss 0-4

Game 13: Tammy – ![Rhydon](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/112.png) ![Nidoqueen](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/031.png) ![Wigglytuff](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/040.png) ![Gyarados](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/130.png) ![Alakazam](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/065.png) ![Moltres](http://serebii.net/pokedex-xy/icon/146.png)

Looking at this team, I knew that Starmie and Nidoking would have a pretty good time against Tammy. We proceeded to trade Rocks, and trade some Pokemon. Eventually, Dragonite managed to Dragon Dance up on his Alakazam, and proceed to break through Alakazam and Gyarados, the two Pokemon that checked Nidoking. Without those Pokemon, Nidoking managed to get through the rest of Tammy’s team. Win 3-0. 
At this point, I was pretty pleased with my record of 11-2, and called it there. You’re allowed 30 battles, but I was satisfied with the 13 that I played. 

There were a few things about the team that I noted. My team got stomped by set up sweepers. Cloyster was an especially large problem. Snorlax seemed to serve as massive set up fodder for Cloysters everywhere, and if it weren’t for a lucky Fissure, I’d have lost more games to it. Defensive teams also gave my team trouble. Game 12 made this painfully obvious. That team was about as close to stall as you could get. The lack of hazard control certainly hurt me in some games. Having a Dragonite stay at full so that its Multiscale stayed active was necessary for most sweeps. I could have run Rapid Spin on Starmie, but the Thunderbolt coverage to deal damage against Water types was deemed more important during teambuilding. 

This team certainly wasn’t perfect, but I’m happy with how it did, especially with zero testing time. Now, the hype train continues to chug for Pokemon Sun/Moon. If you made it this far, thanks for the read. Comics back up soon.
