I don't really know what to say about this [comic](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/sadness-behind-his-eyes). 

The comic originally started with panel 1 and 4. But eventually, I had to fill in panel 2 and 3. And I had to think. And then things. 

I think it's safe to say that we've all been Steve at some point or another, and some more than others. 

All I have to say is that if you've ever felt like Steve, you should know that there's someone that wants to listen, and wants to help. You won't hurt them by how you feel. 

Less serious things tomorrow. Promise.
