Part 2 is up [here](http://drifterswithpencils.com/blog/kanto-classic-results). 

Hello, and welcome to the first of two posts featuring the [Kanto Classic Online Competition](http://3ds.pokemon-gl.com/information/33875ab5-ac2e-4e2d-afa3-567debf8723c). 
Basically, the Kanto Classic is a competition featuring rules from the first generation of Pokemon. Each battle is a 6v6, with each Pokemon set to Lv. 50 and with no items. The Pokemon allowed in the competition are those with a National Pokedex number between 1 and 149. So Bulbasaur to Dragonite, and everything in between, is allowed. 

I really like this competition for a few reasons. 
1. It’s 6v6. Pokemon competitions are never 6v6. This is exciting, since most of the Pokemon competitions are only 3v3 battling. 
2. It’s Generation 1. Now, I’m not one to say that Gen 1 is best gen, but the nostalgia is certainly real. Plus it’s interesting to see how the current competitive metagame has evolved with each of the new generations. There’s no Talonflame, Garchomp, Landorus-T, or Ferrothorn in sight. 

The team I built for the Kanto Classic was really just put together without any testing. Only theorymonning guided the team to its final form.

Clefable  
Ability: Magic Guard  
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD  
Bold Nature  
\- Moonblast  
\- Stealth Rock  
\- Aromatherapy  
\- Moonlight  
The lack of Steel types in Gen 1 made Fairy and Dragon types extremely strong. Clefable was the strongest of the three Fairy types (beating out Wigglytuff and Mr. Mime) and provided nice utility with Stealth Rock. Status was going to be a big deal in this competition (especially without Lum Berry), so instead of jumping on the Thunder Wave bandwagon, I went with Aromatherapy to cure all of the status. Clefable also takes on random Machamps that may run around. Speaking of…

![](http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/rb/machamp.png)![](http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/bw/machamp.gif)  
Machamp  
Ability: No Guard  
EVs: 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
\- Dynamic Punch  
\- Ice Punch  
\- Thunder Punch  
\- Bullet Punch  
Machamp is kind of a strong Pokemon. It deals with Magneton, the one Steel type Pokemon that threatens Clefable. Ice Punch hopes to deal with Dragonites, which can plow through my team when Clefable goes down. Thunder Punch hopes to deal with Slowbro, although it really doesn’t do that much. Bullet Punch is much needed priority for the really slow Machamp, and it also happens to hit Clefable for some chip damage. The 124 Speed EVs makes sure that Machamp outspeeds any form of Snorlax, and annihilate it with Dynamic Punch.

Dragonite  
Ability: Multiscale  
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
\- Outrage  
\- Earthquake  
\- Extreme Speed  
\- Dragon Dance  
Last mon Dragonite is a champion, even without its customary Lum Berry. This is kind of the standard set for most Dragon Dance Dragonites. Outrage is over Dragon Claw for the sheer amount of power. Moving on. 

![](http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/rb/starmie.png)![](http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/bw/starmie.gif)  
Starmie  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
\- Scald  
\- Psyshock  
\- Ice Beam  
\- Thunderbolt  
Starmie is a really important Pokemon for this competition. Its Speed tier allows Starmie to outspeed Gengar and OHKO it with Psyshock. Scald, being the best move in the game and totally fair, is just a really good STAB move overall. Ice Beam is there for Dragonite (I really prepared for Dragonite), and Thunderbolt hits Water types that would want to come in and wall Starmie, such as Blastoise and Lapras. 

![](http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/rb/nidoking.png)![](http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/bw/nidoking.gif)  
Nidoking  
Ability: Sheer Force  
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
\- Earth Power  
\- Sludge Wave  
\- Ice Beam  
\- Sucker Punch  
I’ve really wanted to use Nidoking for a long while. Like, ever since I got swept by my cousin who used a Nidoking. Nidoking serves as the answer to Electric types, as well as Fairy types, especially Calm Mind Clefable, which scares me quite a bit. Ice Beam is there for Dragonite…again. I’m scared of Dragonite. Finally, Sucker Punch is there for essentially the same reason as Bullet Punch for Machamp. Even though I’m running a negative Attack nature on Nidoking, Sucker Punch is a solid 2HKO on Gengar. 

![](http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/rb/snorlax.png)![](http://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/bw/snorlax.gif)  
Snorlax  
Ability: Thick Fat  
EVs: 252 Atk / 92 Def / 164 SpD  
Adamant Nature  
\- Body Slam  
\- Earthquake  
\- Crunch  
\- Fissure  
Snorlax rounds out the team, being a solid SpDef tank. Snorlax also happens to be the hax master, with Body Slam having a nice chance to paralyze the opponent. Earthquake is just a really solid coverage move overall. Crunch is there to deal super effective damage to Gengar, Alakazam, and Slowbro. Finally, Fissure is just…the best move ever. There’s a 30% chance for Snorlax to get you out of a really bad situation, like an out of control setup sweeper. 

Taking a quick glance at the team, an Ice weakness is fairly obvious, facilitating the need for Thick Fat on Snorlax. Shell Smash Cloyster can sweep through this team, especially since Cloyster tanks most physical hits. Slowbro also can be a problem for the team as well. 

General strategies include setting up Stealth Rock as soon as possible, then breaking down Dragonite checks before setting up with Dragon Dance and sweeping. Starmie also has a decent chance of sweeping, thanks to its high Speed, but fast Electric type Pokemon such as Electrode and Jolteon, as well as Alakazam, have to be knocked out. 

Stay tuned for Part 2, where the results of the freshly built team show.
