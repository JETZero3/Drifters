Everyone likes cliche tourist photos, right?

It sadly appears like today's [comic](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/tourist-photo) is a day late. Not entirely unexpected, but it's still not ideal. 

Reasons for the delay include: 

1. The Leaning Tower of Pisa has a lot of freakin' pillars. Since that would be incredibly difficult to draw, it's kind of just a tower of windows. 
2. Cleaning around the house. I have a lot of crap that needs to be thrown out. It was a busy day today. 

So when will the next comic be up? I haven't a clue, and that is the best answer. It creates no expectations, and is not entirely untruthful! It's a win for everyone.
