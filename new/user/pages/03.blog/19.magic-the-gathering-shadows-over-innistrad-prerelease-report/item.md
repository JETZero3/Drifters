Hello, and welcome to a Magic: the Gathering prerelease report. For this report, I'll be discussing my deck used for the Shadows over Innistrad prerelease on April 2nd. (Well, at least the one I went to.)

In case you're in the dark, a prerelease event basically involves you opening up 6 packs, and making your best 40 card deck out of your draft. This particular event was a four round round-robin tournament, with placing determined by your overall record. So, here we go.

##### The Build 

Man, was I excited as I got to my local card shop and plopped down in a chair. It's been a while since I've been to a prerelease, and I was hoping to get some good results. Obviously, this couldn't go badly...

As a player that tends to steer towards white, I was hoping to see a large bomb. Say...[Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409741 "Archangel Avacyn 3WW (5)

~

Legendary Creature — Angel (6/5)

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=409741&type=card) ![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=409742&type=card)

Unfortunately, that didn't happen. However, there was enough usable white cards to start building in it. Mainly, the [Bound by Moonsilver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409745 "Bound by Moonsilver 2W(3)
Enchantment — Aura
Enchant creature
Enchanted creature can't attack, block, or transform.
Sacrifice another permanent: Attach Bound by Moonsilver to target creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery and only once each turn.") and [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409750 "Declaration in Stone 1W (2)
Sorcery
Exile target creature and all other creatures its controller controls with the same name as that creature. That player investigates for each nontoken creature exiled this way.") served as good hard removal. 

However, this left my early game and late game creatures rather lacking. My blue, aside from [Geralf's Masterpiece](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409808 "Geralf's Masterpiece 3UU (5)
Creature — Zombie Horror (7/7)
Flying

3U, Discard three cards: Return Geralf's Masterpiece from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped."), wasn't that strong. Likewise, my black creatures weren't terribly strong. Normally, I'd choose green here. However, there were two red bombs that changed my mind; [Wolf of Devil's Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409949 "Wolf of Devil's Breach 3RR (5)
Creature — Elemental Wolf (5/5)
Whenever Wolf of Devil's Breach attacks, you may pay 1R and discard a card. If you do, Wolf of Devil's Breach deals damage to target creature or planeswalker equal to the discarded card's converted mana cost.") and [Avacyn's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409895 "Avacyn's Judgment 1R (2)
Sorcery
Madness XR (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)
Avacyn's Judgment deals 2 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures and/or players. If Avacyn's Judgment's madness cost was paid, it deals X damage divided as you choose among those creatures and/or players instead."). 

![Wolf of Devil's Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=409949&type=card) ![Avacyn's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=409895&type=card)


I knew [Wolf of Devil's Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409949 "Wolf of Devil's Breach 3RR (5)
Creature — Elemental Wolf (5/5)
Whenever Wolf of Devil's Breach attacks, you may pay 1R and discard a card. If you do, Wolf of Devil's Breach deals damage to target creature or planeswalker equal to the discarded card's converted mana cost.") would put in work, and if I got the wombo combo with [Avacyn's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409895 "Avacyn's Judgment 1R (2)
Sorcery
Madness XR (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)
Avacyn's Judgment deals 2 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures and/or players. If Avacyn's Judgment's madness cost was paid, it deals X damage divided as you choose among those creatures and/or players instead."), it would be a massive tempo swing. Even without the combo, [Avacyn's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409895 "Avacyn's Judgment 1R (2)
Sorcery
Madness XR (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)
Avacyn's Judgment deals 2 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures and/or players. If Avacyn's Judgment's madness cost was paid, it deals X damage divided as you choose among those creatures and/or players instead.") is flexible removal, and [Wolf of Devil's Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409949 "Wolf of Devil's Breach 3RR (5)
Creature — Elemental Wolf (5/5)
Whenever Wolf of Devil's Breach attacks, you may pay 1R and discard a card. If you do, Wolf of Devil's Breach deals damage to target creature or planeswalker equal to the discarded card's converted mana cost.") is a 5/5 body with pseudo-evasion. As well, [Ember-Eye Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409906 "Ember-Eye Wolf 1R (2)
Creature — Wolf (1/2)
Haste
1R: Ember-Eye Wolf gets +2/+0 until end of turn.") filled out my curve at the 2-drop spot. 

I added a few Equipment cards to strengthen my somewhat weak board, as well as to synergize with [Avacynian Missionaries ](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409743 "Avacynian Missionaries 3W (4)

Artifact — Equipment
Equipped creature gets +1/+1 and has vigilance.
As long as equipped creature is a Human, it gets an additional +1/+0.
Equip 2 (2: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)") was just generally solid, especially with vigilence. 

##### The Games

###### Round 1: Justin 

My first opponent was against a blue/black deck. He managed to drop [Geralf's Masterpiece](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409808 "Geralf's Masterpiece 3UU (5)
Creature — Zombie Horror (7/7)
Flying

3U, Discard three cards: Return Geralf's Masterpiece from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped.") on both games. Fortunately, it was dealt with by [Bound by Moonsilver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409745 "Bound by Moonsilver 2W(3)
Enchantment — Aura
Enchant creature

Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery and only once each turn.") in the first game, and [Puncturing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409775 "Puncturing Light 1W (2)
Instant

Creature — Wolf (1/2)
Haste
1R: Ember-Eye Wolf gets +2/+0 until end of turn.") proved its worth, hitting early and often for 3 to 5 damage consistently. 

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=409906&type=card)

[Avacyn's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409895 "Avacyn's Judgment 1R (2)
Sorcery
Madness XR (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)
Avacyn's Judgment deals 2 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures and/or players. If Avacyn's Judgment's madness cost was paid, it deals X damage divided as you choose among those creatures and/or players instead.") managed to push for just enough damage in the first game, and [Wolf of Devil's Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409949 "Wolf of Devil's Breach 3RR (5)
Creature — Elemental Wolf (5/5)
Whenever Wolf of Devil's Breach attacks, you may pay 1R and discard a card. If you do, Wolf of Devil's Breach deals damage to target creature or planeswalker equal to the discarded card's converted mana cost.") cleared the way in the second game. 

1 - 0

###### Round 2: Tyler

Feeling good after my color choices, I went into the second game against one of two Tylers at the prerelease. He ran a primarily white deck, with some green thrown in there. He who managed to put down a very scary [Always Watching](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409737 "Always Watching 1WW (3)
Enchantment
Nontoken creatures you control get +1/+1 and have vigilance.") both games.

My removal was invaluable in the first game, but he countered with a [Descend upon the Sinful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409751 " Descend upon the Sinful 4WW (6)

At the beginning of each combat, creatures you control gain first strike until end of turn if a creature you control has first strike. The same is true for flying, deathtouch, double strike, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace, reach, skulk, trample, and vigilance.") came down onto the board. Odric managed to give all of my creatures flying, first with a clutch [Topplegeist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409785 "Topplegeist W (1)

Creature — Human Soldier (3/2)

The second game was quicker, with [Ember-Eye Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409906 "Ember-Eye Wolf 1R (2)
Creature — Wolf (1/2)
Haste
1R: Ember-Eye Wolf gets +2/+0 until end of turn.") pushing for early damage. [Avacynian Missionaries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409743 "Avacynian Missionaries 3W (4)

2 - 0

###### Round 3: Will

Round 3 was unfortunately quick. Will played a more midrange white/black deck that just couldn't get the mana he needed to play out the early game. [Ember-Eye Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409906 "Ember-Eye Wolf 1R (2)
Creature — Wolf (1/2)
Haste
1R: Ember-Eye Wolf gets +2/+0 until end of turn.") and [Devilthorn Fox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409752 "Devilthorn Fox 1W (2)
Creature — Fox (3/1)") pushed hard for early damage. By the time Will stabilized, it was too late.

3 - 0

###### Round 4: Darcy

Since Darcy and I were guaranteed a 1-2 finish, we decided to draw. However, we still played out our games for funsies. 

Darcy played a very strong white/green deck, packing threats such as [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409741 "Archangel Avacyn 3WW (5)

However, he managed to put down his [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409741 "Archangel Avacyn 3WW (5)

##### The Conclusion

In the end, it was the best I had ever done at a prerelease. Looking at the deck, I realize that my late game was painfully lacking in power, with only my [Wolf of Devil's Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409949 "Wolf of Devil's Breach 3RR (5)
Creature — Elemental Wolf (5/5)
Whenever Wolf of Devil's Breach attacks, you may pay 1R and discard a card. If you do, Wolf of Devil's Breach deals damage to target creature or planeswalker equal to the discarded card's converted mana cost.") having anything above 5 power. As well, I only had one discarding engine, in [Wolf of Devil's Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409949 "Wolf of Devil's Breach 3RR (5)
Creature — Elemental Wolf (5/5)

If you do, Wolf of Devil's Breach deals damage to target creature or planeswalker equal to the discarded card's converted mana cost."). I couldn't consistently pull off delirium, and [Avacyn's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409895 "Avacyn's Judgment 1R (2)
Sorcery
Madness XR (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)

However, the deck was a joy to pilot. It turned out to be a lot more aggresive that I originally thought, and there were a few standouts in the deck. Obviously, by the number of times I typed it in the article, [Wolf of Devil's Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409949 "Wolf of Devil's Breach 3RR (5)
Creature — Elemental Wolf (5/5)
Whenever Wolf of Devil's Breach attacks, you may pay 1R and discard a card. If you do, Wolf of Devil's Breach deals damage to target creature or planeswalker equal to the discarded card's converted mana cost.") was a major threat, like most people expected it to be. However, [Ember-Eye Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409906 "Ember-Eye Wolf 1R (2)
Creature — Wolf (1/2)
Haste
1R: Ember-Eye Wolf gets +2/+0 until end of turn.") also put in a lot of work, which was nice, given it was put it almost grudgingly. 

Overall, I fully enjoyed the Shadows over Innistrad prerelease. Big thanks to Tyler (the second of the two Tylers, and the one I...know) for helping with my draft. Hopefully you enjoyed the deck tech as much as I enjoyed writing it up. Maybe I'll write up another one in a few months.
