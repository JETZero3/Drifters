Thanks to Jess for the inspiration for this [comic](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/string-cheese). You know who you are. 

I really enjoyed drawing this comic. The hairstyle for the woman is certainly something I've never done before. I don't even know if it's possible, but I suppose that's the fun of drawing, isn't it? The inspiration came from a Maplestory haircut (Simple Bun). I feel like I've seen the ponytail bit in some sort of anime or something, but I can't for the life of me remember anything about it. What a bother. 

It's also refreshing to make a completely new comic. Sure, remasters are nice and all, but the satisfaction of creating new square pictures can't be beat. 

But seriously...if anyone can give me information on that ponytail, that'd be appreciated.
