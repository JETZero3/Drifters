I wasn't prepared for this game.

the static speaks my name is a first person psychological horror...game? I don't even want to call it a game. I mean, it certainly plays like a game, and there are certainly objectives, but it's darker than a lot of other games I've ever played. The closest thing I can relate it to is [Fingerbones](http://store.steampowered.com/app/391270/). 

the static speaks my name doesn't hit you with jump scares, and it doesn't go for immediate payoff. It's more content to make you very uncomfortable with the environment and mood. You wake up, and you go through your morning routine, which starts off relatively normal. But as you go through, you notice more and more things that make you uneasy. The lack of lights, the boards, the static TVs, the recurring painting. As you explore throughout the house, you find more and more disturbing things. Not scary outright, but certainly strange enough to make you feel tense. 

There's a lot of other places you can go to get an analysis of the game, but there's one thing that I don't think people look into, really. When you have to make your choice about who's story you want to see, it really makes you think. Why did you choose the one you chose? What made you pick that story over another? It's...interesting to think about. 

There are certainly a lot of dark topics that come with the static speaks my name. Depression and suicide are at the forefront of this game, and it doesn't attempt to sugarcoat them. When you're suffering from depression, you really don't want to do anything. Even getting yourself food is a massive struggle. The only other picture that isn't trees shows your shrimps. Your babies. And you have to give up one of the few joys that you had left in life. It hurts in all the worst ways. the static speaks my name doesn't pull punches, although I do wish it showed another way out past your eventual suicide. There's always alternatives, and no matter how bad it hurts, there's always a better way. 

For what it's worth, the static speaks my name is a free game [here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/387860/), and it only takes 10 minutes to complete. It's really not a game for everyone. Not even close. But I appreciate the fact that it exists. 

Happiness for the next post. Promise.
