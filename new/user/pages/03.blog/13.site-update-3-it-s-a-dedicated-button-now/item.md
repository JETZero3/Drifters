Small update here. The afterthought for each comic now has a dedicated button, sandwiched between the "Random" and "Next" buttons. 

As well, I think I might have a schedule sorted out. I'm thinking a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule might be alright. It avoids my busy days for now, plus it's not a Monday/Wednesday/Friday thing. The second one really doesn't matter that much, but it's just a thought. An afterthought.
