Man, it took more time that it should have to come up with a pun for the [comic](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/pawn-of-a-new-era). 

New comic for today. I rather like the idea, but I don't really like the execution of it too much. It kinda looks weird for me, in a way I can't explain that well...

The idea's been in my head for a little bit now. It actually started out as an Antiques Roadshow thing, but the reality pawn shop show just kinda turned out a bit better for the formatting. 

Also, if you couldn't tell, I've never been to a pawn shop. I have no idea if this is the typical interaction. I can only assume it's not, but I have nothing else to go with, so yeah.
