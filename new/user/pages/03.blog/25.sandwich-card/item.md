Apologies about the missed Friday update. Will this [comic](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/sandwich-card) make it up to you?

This comic epitomizes what Drifters with Pencils is all about. A weird situation that probably would never happen, combined with a joke that probably I only like. Also included is talking about sandwiches. I'm all about sandwiches. 

Oh, and shading. There's that as well.
