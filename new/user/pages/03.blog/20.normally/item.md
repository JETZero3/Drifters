So you want to hear a secret about this [comic](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/normally)? 

I don't like it. 

When I came up with the "Normally, Yes" idea, I kinda liked the thought of it. However, I never really gave the surrounding words much thought. The first panel and the last panel I feel could be a lot better. However, I just can't think of how. 

Sigh. How very bothersome.
