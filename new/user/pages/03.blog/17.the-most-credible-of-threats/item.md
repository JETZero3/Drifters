Woo, new [comic](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/the-most-credible-of-threats)!

They're finally back. I figure a Monday/Friday schedule would work for me. Two days a week for comic seems doable for me right now. Plus I have a bit of a backlog, so I don't have to worry much about it. 

I like how this one turned out, although I would have enjoyed a darker tone in the third panel. However, there's only so much you can do with a stick figure, and there's only so much I can do with my limited skill set. Still, it's nice. 

Next comic will be a remaster of what is probably my most well received comic to date. Probably.
