It's an [remaster](http://drifterswithpencils.com/archive/signs) today. 

I really found myself struggling to make this comic today. Not in the way that it was difficult to draw. I just didn't have the motivation today. Lots of things are happening, and they are weighing on me. And I won't make this site a place to showcase struggles or difficulties, but it kind of segues into the next part. 

I'll be taking a bit of a break for the next week or so. I'd like to steadily build up a backlog, so that I can kind of maintain a schedule. At least that's the hope. 

Maybe some afterthoughts will find their way onto the site. We'll see what happens. Not that a lot of people are listening. Who knows, maybe no one is listening. I guess that's not really the point of all of this though.
