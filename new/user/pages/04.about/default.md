## Drifters with Pencils
Drifters with Pencils is a comic involving stick figures and awful puns, unrealistic situations, and generally silliness. Drifters was started during my university years, when the desire to escape the monotony of lectures became a thing. Drifters with Pencils updates every Monday and Friday.
